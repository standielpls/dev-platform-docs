title: Get action details and needs
openapi: post /api/v2/apps/{app}/actions/{action}/
---

"Needs" are the values that need to be provided when the action is run. Needs that are not provided will be guessed by the AI when the action is run.

"Gives" are the values that the action returns when it is run.

"Sample" is a sample of what the action returns when it is run.

When you [Run a stateless action](/guides/how-tos/stateless/run-stateless-action), "needs" are provided to the endpoint. For each need, you can either have AI guess a value for it or you can ask the user to provide a specific value.

## Custom fields

<Warning>
The list of needs that this returns can change based on the `params` provided in the request body.

As such, this endpoint may need to be hit multiple times as needs are chosen by the user.

</Warning>

This endpoint needs to be hit again whenever the selected value for a need changes and _any of the following_ are true:

- The changed need has `alters_custom_fields` set to `true`
- The changed need is in the `depends_on` array of another need
- The changed need has `custom_field` set to `true`

As an example, when using the `GoogleSheetsV2API` API with the `add_row` action, the first time you get the action you will get back these `action_needs`:

```json
{
  "action_needs": [
    {
      "key": "spreadsheet",
      "label": "Spreadsheet",
      "prefill": "spreadsheet.id.title",
      "custom_field": false,
      "depends_on": [],
      "alters_custom_fields": true
    },
    {
      "key": "worksheet",
      "label": "Worksheet",
      "prefill": "worksheet.id.title",
      "custom_field": false,
      "depends_on": ["spreadsheet"],
      "alters_custom_fields": true
    }
  ]
}
```

In order to get the column names of the spreadsheet, you'll have to get the prefill choices. See [Get Prefill Choices](/guides/how-tos/action-info/prefill-choices) for more information.

In this example scenario, after getting values for the `spreadsheet` and `worksheet` prefills, another call can be made to this endpoint.

This time, in the body of the `POST`, we can include the selected values:

```json
{
  "params": {
    "spreadsheet": "SOME_SPREADSHEET_ID", // this is the ID of a spreadsheet in Google Sheets
    "worksheet": "0" // the first worksheet in the spreadsheet
  }
}
```

Now, the action details will include the columns from the spreadsheet as custom fields:

```json
{
  "action_details": [
    // ... same results as above, in addition to...
    {
      "key": "COL$A",
      "label": "My first column",
      "prefill": null,
      "custom_field": true,
      "depends_on": [],
      "alters_custom_fields": null
    },
    {
      "key": "COL$B",
      "label": "My second column",
      "prefill": null,
      "custom_field": true,
      "depends_on": [],
      "alters_custom_fields": null
    },
    {
      "key": "COL$C",
      "label": "My third column",
      "prefill": null,
      "custom_field": true,
      "depends_on": [],
      "alters_custom_fields": null
    }
  ]
}
```

## Choices

If the need has a `choices` array, then the value being chosen should come from that list.

Often, you will see this with `boolean` fields.

For example, the `SlackAPI` API's `direct_message` action contains the following need (irrelevant fields removed):

```json
{
  "key": "as_bot",
  "type": "boolean",
  "label": "Send as a bot?",
  "choices": [
    {
      "key": "no",
      "label": "No"
    },
    {
      "key": "yes",
      "label": "Yes"
    }
  ],
  "default": "yes",
  "format": "SELECT"
}
```

## Other field types

See [Field definitions and types](https://platform.zapier.com/build/field-definitions) in the Zapier Platform documentation for details on the other types of fields that a need can have.
