When using AI Actions, you will first have to build up information about the action that you want to run.

## When do I need to gather action information?

See [Stored vs. Stateless Actions](/guides/how-tos/stateless-vs-stored) for more information.

You do **not** need to gather this information if:

- You're running a **stored action** that is configured in the AI Actions UI

You **do** need to gather this information if:

- You're running a **stateless action**
- You're setting up a new stored action using the stored action management API

## Gathering action information

<Steps>
    <Step stepNumber={1} title="Find the app you want to use" titleSize="h3">
        Each action lives under an app, for example Google Sheets or Slack.

        You first need to choose which app you will want to use to run an action.

        See [Find an app](/guides/how-tos/action-info/find-app) for more details.
    </Step>
    <Step stepNumber={2} title="Find the action you want to run" titleSize="h3">
        Once you know the app you want to use, you can choose which action you want to run for that app.

        See [Find an action](/guides/how-tos/action-info/find-action) for more details.
    </Step>
    <Step stepNumber={3} title="Find the user's auth" titleSize="h3">
        Every app has authentications that are configured in Zapier for each user.

        To run an action, you need to know which Zapier account and app authentication that you want to run the action with.

        See [Choose authentication](/guides/how-tos/action-info/choose-auth) for more details.
    </Step>
    <Step stepNumber={4} title="Get action details and prefill choices" titleSize="h3">
        Each action has a number of "needs" that can be used to decide what values to run the action with.

        See [Get action details and needs](/guides/how-tos/action-info/action-details) for more details.

        Some of these needs are have a `prefill` key, which means that they provide a list of values that can be chosen from.

        See [Get prefill choices](/guides/how-tos/action-info/prefill-choices) for more details.

        <Tip>
        **You don't have to get a value for every need!**

        When running an action, you can have the AI guess values based on instructions.
        </Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step stepNumber={5} title="Run or save the action" titleSize="h3">
        Once you have all of the details you need, you can either run the action as a stateless action, or save the details for later.

        See [Stored vs Stateless Actions](/guides/how-tos/stateless-vs-stored) for more information.
