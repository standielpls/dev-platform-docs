title: Stored Vs. Stateless Actions
---

When using the AI Actions API, there are two ways that actions can be run: stored and stateless.

## Stored Actions

With stored actions, you let us handle storing all of the details about an action.

You will only need to provide the user instructions and parameter hints when running the action.

  Stored actions are configured ahead of time, either using the AI Actions UI or
  the provided management endpoints.
  <br />
  Only user instructions and parameter hints are needed when running them.

  A `@zapier/ai-actions-react` package is available to make it easy to interact
  with stored actions from a React application.

## Stateless Actions

With stateless actions, you provide all of the necessary parameters at runtime.

This means you will have to store action details yourself or generate the action every time you want to run it.

  Stateless actions are run by providing all the necessary parameters at
  runtime.

  This gives you greater control over how actions are run.
