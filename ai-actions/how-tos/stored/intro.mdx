        Actions need to be configured by a user before they can be used.

        There are two ways to set up stored actions:
        1. Using the AI Actions website- see [Configure stored actions](/guides/how-tos/stored/action-configuration) for more details.
        2. Using the AI Action management API provided under [Manage stored actions](/guides/how-tos/stored/manage/create-action).
