title: Compute a field from the data of the Test API call
description: Zapier doesn't store the responses from the test API call for OAuth v2 and session authentication. Using computed fields, you can use data from a test API call later in your Zapier integration.
---
## Prerequisites

*   Knowledge of working with APIs
*   Understanding of computed field concept
*   Familiarity with JavaScript

## Steps

1.  Log into the [Platform UI](https://zapier.com/app/developer).
2.  Select your **integration**.
3.  In the _Build_ section in the left sidebar, click your **authentication**.
    *   For Session authentication:
        *   Click **Configure a Token Exchange Request**
        *   Click **Switch to Code Mode**.
    *   For OAuth v2 authentication:
        *   Click **Add OAuth v2 Endpoint Configuration**.
        *   Click **Switch to Code Mode**.
4.  Add **custom JavaScript code** to instruct Zapier to call both the URLs necessary for the authorization process and your test API call.
5.  Click **Save & Continue**.
6.  The _Test Request_ section remains unchanged.
7.  Return [computed fields](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform/blob/main/packages/cli/README.md#computed-fields) for data returned from either API call so you can reference those fields in subsequent steps as `bundle.authData.field` where `field` is the field's name from your test API call response.

Upon completion, you will be able to use data from a test API call as a computed field in later stages of your Zapier integration.
